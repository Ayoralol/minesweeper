# Java Console Minesweeper

The outline of this project was to create a minesweeper game in Java, playable in the console. The MVP was a working minesweeper 10x10 square with 10 bombs. Extra tasks were to make it re-sizeable and to add the cascading effect on empty squares.

I implemented all of this and also added coloring to the text with ANSI color codes to better distinguish the squares

This was built entirely using Java in VSC and Eclipse IDE
